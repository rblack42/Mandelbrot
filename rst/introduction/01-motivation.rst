This project is incomplete by design. The code does work, but is presented as
an example of a project put together in a hurry, never a good way to develop
anything.

Students are asked to take this project and get into a shape worthy of being
used in a real way. Features need to be cleaned up, documentation improved, and
in general the code needs to be organized in a way that it could be maintained
over a long period of time.

Students are asked to work in a team to work on these issues. When the project
is completed, all teams are put through a peer-review in class where their work
is critiqued.
